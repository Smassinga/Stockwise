## Tauri-Specific Considerations

### File System Access
All file operations in the application use standard browser download mechanisms which are fully supported in Tauri:
- CSV exports use the `file-saver` library
- XLSX exports use the `xlsx` library with `file-saver`
- PDF exports use `jspdf` with `file-saver`

### Dialog Interactions
The application uses the Tauri wrapper library (`src/lib/tauri.ts`) for all dialog interactions:
- Message dialogs
- File open dialogs
- File save dialogs

### Internationalization
The i18n system uses localStorage which is available in Tauri applications:
- Language preference is stored in localStorage
- All translations are loaded from JSON files bundled with the application

## Version Updates
- Updated package.json version from 0.0.0 to 1.2.0
- Updated src-tauri/tauri.conf.json version from 0.1.0 to 1.2.0

## Testing Recommendations
1. Verify that all export functionality works correctly (CSV, XLSX, PDF)
2. Test internationalization in both English and Portuguese
3. Confirm that dialog interactions work properly
4. Validate that all UI components render correctly in the Tauri window
5. Ensure that payment terms display correctly in both Suppliers and Customers pages

## Known Limitations
- Some fallback mechanisms in the Tauri wrapper may show browser alerts instead of native dialogs in web environments
- File system operations are limited to download functionality; direct file system access is restricted by Tauri security policies
