   - Tables become horizontally scrollable on small screens

2. **Mobile Components**:
   - MobileAddLineButton with touch-friendly interactions
   - useIsMobile hook for mobile detection
   - Responsive button sizing

3. **Touch Optimization**:
   - Touch targets are appropriately sized (minimum 44px)
   - Mobile-safe event handling in components
   - Enhanced mobile menu with smooth animations

## Recent Improvements

### 1. Enhanced App Layout

3. **Firefox Mobile** (Android)
4. **Samsung Internet** (Android)

### Performance Testing

1. **Load times**: Ensure pages load quickly on mobile networks
2. **Memory usage**: Monitor for memory leaks on mobile devices
3. **Battery usage**: Optimize animations and background processes

## Accessibility on Mobile

### Touch Target Sizes

All interactive elements meet minimum touch target sizes:
- **Minimum**: 44px × 44px
- **Recommended**: 48px × 48px for frequently used controls

### Screen Reader Compatibility

1. Test with VoiceOver (iOS) and TalkBack (Android)
2. Ensure proper focus management
3. Verify ARIA labels are appropriate for mobile

### Keyboard Navigation

Although less common on mobile, ensure keyboard navigation works for:
- External keyboards
- Accessibility tools
- Power users

## Performance Optimization for Mobile

### Bundle Size

1. **Code splitting**: Ensure proper code splitting for mobile users
2. **Image optimization**: Use responsive images with appropriate sizes
3. **Lazy loading**: Implement lazy loading for non-critical components

### Network Optimization

1. **Caching**: Implement effective caching strategies
